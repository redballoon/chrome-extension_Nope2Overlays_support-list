# Nope 2 Overlays Supported Sites List

a chrome extension that aims to improve your browsing experience. Removes intrusive popups, pay walls, signup walls, sign-in walls, adblock reminders, email newsletter overlays, and special offers modals.

Initially created for personal use after having one too many bad experiences with other extensions. Some would work for simple sites but eventually fail on another site. Most extensions use the same logic for all sites, ignoring the fact that sites are unique.

We aim to be a constantly evolving extension with the help of Chrome users to stay ahead of the curve and keep bad popups down.

### Features:
- No Permissions Needed.
- No performance impact on your browsing. It will only activate when triggered. No background scripts.
- Your preferences are not saved, just refresh to see the popups you removed again.
- Defaults to using a generic logic for most unknown sites.
- With your help we can identify and grow a list of sites
that circumvent extensions like this one and add them to our 'supported' list.
- Custom logic for all sites on the 'supported' list to guarantee removal of popups and free updates
when the sites change/update.
- Supported list of sites is available publicly on Github to make it easier to track and update. Those who are familiar with the site can create pull requests or issues for sites they have identified. You can also send us sites to add through this [form](https://goo.gl/forms/4shqVwIRPgonvprr2)
